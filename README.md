A simple PHP web app to manage your personal collection of electronic music tracks.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or PHP built-in server)

## How to Add a New Track
1. Go to the **Add Song** page in your browser (`/add-song.php`).
2. Fill in the song details (title, artist, genre, duration).
3. Click **Add Song to Library**.
4. (Optional) To enable playback, place the corresponding `.mp3` file in the `audio/` folder. The file name should match the song title, with spaces replaced by hyphens (e.g., `My-Track.mp3`).

That's it! Enjoy listening to your techno.

For tracks with complex names (Spaces or special chars included.) try to replaces spaces with "-" and complex chars, look for their decoding of HTML and paste them in the name of the mp3 file.
Stay hard & keep coding.
